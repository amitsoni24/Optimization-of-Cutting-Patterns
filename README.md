# Optimization-of-Cutting-Patterns
Welcome to my GitHub repository for solving the optimal cutting pattern problem! This project focuses on minimizing material waste and maximizing material usage for a given stock through advanced algorithmic techniques and linear programming. The solution leverages the CPLEX solver to find the most efficient cutting patterns.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an algorithm that minimizes material waste by selecting the optimal cutting patterns for a given stock length and required cuts. By maximizing material usage, the algorithm ensures that the cutting process is both cost-effective and efficient.

# Approach
Initialization: The algorithm begins with initial cutting patterns based on the provided stock length and required cuts.
Linear Programming with CPLEX: The initial patterns are used to set up a Linear Programming (LP) problem with constraints. The CPLEX solver is employed to solve this LP problem, generating dual values in the process.
Pattern Generation: Using the dual values obtained from the LP solution, the algorithm generates the next optimal cutting pattern by maximizing the objective function 
𝑍𝑗−𝐶𝑗 through Integer Programming (IP).
Iteration: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively. The process continues until the best 
𝑍𝑗−𝐶𝑗 value becomes negative, ensuring that the optimal solution is reached.

# Key Features
Efficient Initialization: Starts with practical cutting patterns based on stock and requirements.
Advanced Solver Integration: Utilizes the CPLEX solver for solving LP and IP problems, ensuring robust and accurate optimization.
Iterative Optimization: Continuously improves cutting patterns through iterative refinement, leveraging dual values for enhanced pattern generation.
Material Waste Minimization: Focuses on reducing waste and maximizing the use of available material, leading to cost savings and efficiency.
